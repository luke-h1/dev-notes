## ARRAY DESTRUCTURING 

* Destructuring is an assignment syntax in Javascript that allows you to extract data from arrays using syntax that mirrors the construction of array or object literals 

Example 
```
var a, b; 
[a, b] = [1, 2] 
// a is equal to 1 and b is equal to 2 
```

Array destructuring example: 
```
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']; 

// destructuring... 

var [one, two, three] = foo; 
/* 
The above is equivalent to: 
var one = foo[0]; 
var two = foo[1]; 
var three = foo[2]; 
*/
