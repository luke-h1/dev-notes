## REST APIS 

* An API is essentially a contract provided by one piece of software to another. It usually consists of a structured request and a structured response. I.e. one piece of software says give me this information formatted in this way and I’ll give you this data. 


* REST stands for representational state transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It works by relying on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, almost always HTTP. REST was made to treat objects on the server side as resources that can be created, read, updated & destroyed. An example of a server side object would be a blog post or a user etc. This is usually stored in a database. You can create resources with a POST request, you can delete with a DELETE request  and so on. 

* Since REST operates by just using HTTP requests & some standard such as JSON it can be used by   virtually any programming language. 

* An API is the messenger and REST lets you use HTTP requests to format that message. 

* A rest API takes in multiple types of HTTP requests.
